						<h2>About me</h2>
					</header>
					<p> Hi my name is Charlotte Cross also known as Charli. I am a thrid year university student at Australian Catholic University. 
    I am studying a Bachelor of Education (Secondary) and Bachelor of Arts (Design Innovations and Technologies).
    I specialise in teaching Food Technology and Textiles, and I’m passionate about combining creativity with practical learning in the classroom. 
    Throughout my degree, I’ve developed a strong foundation in curriculum planning, assessment, and inclusive teaching strategies. 
    I also have a lot of hands on experience working with diverse learners, including students with ADHD and ESL backgrounds, which has helped me develop a responsive and student-centred teaching style.</p>

				<div class="content box style2">
				<p>Alongside my studies, I’ve had opportunities to work on real world design and education projects. 
				These include developing a board game to teach design thinking in senior Food Technology, creating lesson plans aligned with the NSW syllabus, and conducting product analysis and redesigns for sustainability and inclusivity. 
				My goal is to foster engaging, supportive learning environments where students feel confident to experiment, problem-solve, and express their ideas through food and textiles. 
				I’m excited to continue growing as an educator and to contribute meaningfully to a school community.</p>
