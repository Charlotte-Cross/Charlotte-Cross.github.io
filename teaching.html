            <section>
                <p>I aim to create learning spaces where every student feels included, supported, and inspired to explore their abilities. My lessons are practical and connected to real-life food and textile industry contexts, allowing students to see the relevance of what they’re learning. I adapt activities to meet different needs, using clear demonstrations, visual aids, and step-by-step guidance so all learners can experience success.
                <p> Encouraging students to take ownership of their learning is important to me. Through project-based tasks, hands-on challenges, and opportunities for creative thinking, students develop confidence as makers, problem-solvers, and innovators. I emphasise that mistakes are a natural and valuable part of the process, helping to build resilience and adaptability.  
                <p>Whether we’re working on a recipe, a textile project, or a product design, I focus on developing both technical skills and self-belief, ensuring students leave with knowledge they can carry into their future.

                <p>As a teacher, I want my classroom to be a place where students feel safe, respected, and supported to take risks in their learning. I focus on making lessons engaging, practical, and connected to real world contexts, especially in Food Technology and Textiles, so students can see how their skills matter beyond school. 
                <p></p>I use clear instructions, step-by-step demonstrations, and hands-on activities to help all learners, including those who need extra support or language assistance, succeed. I believe in breaking tasks down, modelling expectations, and celebrating progress – not just the end result. 
                <p></p>Building positive relationships is at the heart of my teaching; I get to know my students and create an environment where they feel confident to ask questions and try new things. 
                <p></p>My goal is for every student to leave my class with practical skills, creativity, and the belief that they can achieve more than they thought possible.</p>

        <h2>Creating a Supportive Working and Learning Enviroment</h2>
        <p>Playing calming music in the classroom helps create a relaxed and focused learning environment. 
        It can reduce stress, support concentration, and improve student engagement. Calming music encourages 
        positive behaviour, eases transitions between tasks, and helps students 
        feel comfortable. It also fosters creativity, making the classroom atmosphere more welcoming and productive.</p>
