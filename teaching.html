        <section>
            <p>I aim to create learning spaces where every student feels included, supported, and inspired to explore their abilities. My lessons are practical and connected to real-life food and textile industry contexts, allowing students to see the relevance of what they’re learning. I adapt activities to meet different needs, using clear demonstrations, visual aids, and step-by-step guidance so all learners can experience success.
            <p> Encouraging students to take ownership of their learning is important to me. Through project-based tasks, hands-on challenges, and opportunities for creative thinking, students develop confidence as makers, problem-solvers, and innovators. I emphasise that mistakes are a natural and valuable part of the process, helping to build resilience and adaptability.  
            <p>Whether we’re working on a recipe, a textile project, or a product design, I focus on developing both technical skills and self-belief, ensuring students leave with knowledge they can carry into their future.

            <p>As a teacher, I want my classroom to be a place where students feel safe, respected, and supported to take risks in their learning. I focus on making lessons engaging, practical, and connected to real world contexts, especially in Food Technology and Textiles, so students can see how their skills matter beyond school. 
            <p></p>I use clear instructions, step-by-step demonstrations, and hands-on activities to help all learners, including those who need extra support or language assistance, succeed. I believe in breaking tasks down, modelling expectations, and celebrating progress – not just the end result. 
            <p></p>Building positive relationships is at the heart of my teaching; I get to know my students and create an environment where they feel confident to ask questions and try new things. 
            <p></p>My goal is for every student to leave my class with practical skills, creativity, and the belief that they can achieve more than they thought possible.</p>
