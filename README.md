# Teaching Portfolio Website (COMP208 A2)

A straightforward portfolio made for COMP208, showing details about me and my teaching carrer/life so far. 
It uses **semantic HTML**, **external CSS** (starter.css), and a bit of **JavaScript** to show good front-end practice. The site is hosted on  **GitHub Pages**.
Changed layout to be similar to a HTML5 layout as well as a Canva rendition done for assessment 2. 

- **Pages:** Home, About, Teaching, Samples of Work (card layout), Resume and Contact (styled form)
- **Live:** https://charlotte-cross.github.io/

## Tech
- HTML5 + CSS3 (external stylesheet)
- GitHub Pages for hosting
